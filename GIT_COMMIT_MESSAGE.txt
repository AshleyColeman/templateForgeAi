docs: Update all documentation to reflect Ollama/OpenAI support (not AWS Bedrock)

SUMMARY:
- Implementation already supported Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter

- Task documentation archived after successful completion

CHANGES:
- Created .env.example with all LLM provider configurations

- Updated cost analysis (Ollama = FREE, OpenAI = $0.10-0.30/site)
- Simplified installation steps (no AWS account needed)
- Created archive documentation and migration notes

IMPACT:
- Users can now use FREE Ollama option
- Setup simplified (no AWS CLI required)
- Cost reduced by 100% with Ollama vs documented Bedrock costs
- Documentation now accurately reflects implementation

FILES CHANGED:
- .env.example (new)
- README.md
- docs/category_res_eng_guide/ (30+ files)
- docs/category_res_eng_guide/tasks/ â†’ tasks_archive/ (14 files)

- Type-safe (mypy compliant)
