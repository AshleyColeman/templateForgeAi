## 🚀 Getting Started

### For New Developers

1. **Read First**: `00_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`
   - Understand the mission and architecture
   - Review technology stack
   - Learn code style guidelines

2. **Review Plan**: `MASTER_TASKLIST.md`
   - See overall project structure
   - Understand task dependencies
   - Track your progress

3. **Start Implementation**: `01_environment_setup.md`
   - Work through tasks sequentially
   - Follow specifications exactly
   - Test thoroughly at each step

### For AI-Assisted Development

If you're using an AI assistant (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) to help implement:

1. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md`
2. Copy the prompt and provide it to your AI assistant
3. Work through tasks one by one
4. Review and test all AI-generated code

**Total**: 40-60 hours

## 🎯 Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 1-3)
**Goal**: Set up environment and data layer

```
Environment → Configuration → Database
```

**Outcome**: Can connect to database and manage configuration

### Phase 2: Core Agent (Tasks 4-7)
**Goal**: Build the AI agent and its tools

```
Core Agent → Page Analyzer → Category Extractor → Blueprint Generator
```

**Outcome**: Can analyze pages and extract categories

### Phase 3: Interface (Tasks 8-10)
**Goal**: Add CLI and error handling

```
CLI → Error Handling → Blueprint System
```

**Outcome**: Production-ready system with robust error handling

### Phase 4: Testing (Task 11)
**Goal**: Comprehensive test coverage

```
Unit Tests → Integration Tests → E2E Tests
```

**Outcome**: 80%+ test coverage, all tests passing

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Spec-Driven Development

We're following **specification-driven development**:
- Detailed specs written first
- Implementation follows specs exactly
- No "creative liberties" or extra features
- Test against specs

### 2. Sequential Implementation

Tasks must be done **in order**:
- Each task builds on previous ones
- Dependencies clearly marked
- Can't skip ahead
- Must validate before proceeding

### 3. Test-Last Approach

Testing comes last (Task 11):
- Focus on getting it working first
- Comprehensive tests at the end
- Not ideal but pragmatic for this project
- Tests validate entire system

## ✅ Validation Process

After each task:

1. **Self-Review**
   - Re-read specifications
   - Check all requirements met
   - Verify validation checklist

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Run the code
   - Test happy path
   - Test error cases
   - Check logs

3. **Integration Check**
   - Ensure works with previous tasks
   - No regressions
   - Dependencies satisfied

4. **Git Commit**
   - Commit working code
   - Meaningful commit message
   - Keep commits atomic

5. **Update Progress**
   - Mark task complete in MASTER_TASKLIST.md
   - Note any issues or learnings
   - Record actual time spent

## 🚨 Important Guidelines

### Do's ✅

- Follow specifications exactly
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Log all important operations
- Write clear docstrings
- Test incrementally
- Ask questions if unclear
- Take breaks when stuck

### Don'ts ❌

- Skip tasks or go out of order
- Add features not in spec
- Skip error handling
- Forget to test
- Hardcode values
- Ignore logging
- Rush through tasks

## 📊 Progress Tracking

Update `MASTER_TASKLIST.md` after each task:

```markdown
### Task N: [Name]
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Actual Time**: X hours
**Notes**: [Any observations or issues]
```

## 🆘 Getting Help

### If You're Stuck

1. **Re-read the task specification** - often the answer is there
2. **Check previous tasks** - similar patterns might exist
3. **Review reference docs** - `docs/category_res_eng_guide/`
4. **Test in isolation** - break down the problem
5. **Check environment** - verify AWS/DB credentials
6. **Ask specific questions** - better than "it doesn't work"

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Time Management

- **Don't rush** - quality over speed
- **Take breaks** - avoid burnout
- **Set realistic goals** - 4-6 hours per session max
- **Track time** - helps with estimation

### Code Quality

- **Read code out loud** - catches errors
- **Pair program** - even with an AI assistant
- **Refactor as you go** - don't accumulate tech debt
- **Keep it simple** - avoid over-engineering

### Testing

- **Test early, test often** - don't wait until the end
- **Test error cases** - not just happy path
- **Use real data** - test with actual websites
- **Verify in database** - check data persists correctly
